# Current release: POEM 2.18.3

Payments Release Consolidation & Operations QA. See [release notes](docs/PHASE-2.18.3.md), [WSL upgrade](docs/UPGRADE-2.18.3.md) and [validation](docs/VALIDATION-2.18.3.md).

POEM 2.18.3 freezes the provider-independent payment core after runtime stabilization. It adds no database migration and no new money-movement architecture. Instead it consolidates the discovered 2.18 regression fixes, adds one payment-suite command, formalizes permission/reconciliation QA, and makes the current JazzCash/Easypaisa manual + mock workflow the release baseline until official provider APIs are available.

## 2.18.3 release rules

- Database migration head remains `20261008000930_withdrawal_operations_manual_settlement.sql`; 2.18.3 adds no migration.
- `npm run test:payments` runs the complete 2.17.0 → 2.18.3 finance/payment regression chain.
- Historical 2.18 UI tests assert behavior/labels rather than one obsolete copy phrase.
- 2.18.2 tests read sensitive withdrawal state only through authorized RPCs; direct authenticated table access remains denied.
- JazzCash and Easypaisa remain the only payout methods. Mock and manual provider modes are supported; live provider APIs are not claimed.
- Existing `work_payable_*` and immutable finance journals remain the payment/accounting sources of truth.
- Payment core is considered freeze-ready only after payment suite, full preflight, local auth/operations tests and browser QA are green.

## Current product boundaries

- Mock wallet verification is a development/testing aid, not live provider ownership verification.
- Manual settlement records a real external JazzCash/Easypaisa transaction reference but does not call provider APIs.
- Wallet/PIN/withdrawal/provider-operation tables remain RPC-only to browser roles and return masked wallet data.
- Bank/IBAN payout methods remain deferred.
- Future JazzCash/Easypaisa adapters must reuse the existing guarded allocation, idempotency, settlement and reconciliation boundaries.

## Historical foundation notes

# POEM Phase 2.3

Standalone React + TypeScript + Vite frontend with Supabase Auth and PostgreSQL. Designed for local WSL development with a local Supabase Docker stack. Independent of the earlier Sites-backed source snapshot.

**Start here:** [WSL setup](docs/SETUP-WSL.md).

**Existing Phase 2.2 users:** follow [safe upgrade instructions](docs/UPGRADE-2.3.md). Keep your existing project folder and database.

**Phase 2.3:** [Needs Assessment & Assistance Follow-up](docs/PHASE-2.3.md).

**Inherited Phase 2.2:** [Registry Review & Assistance Ledger](docs/PHASE-2.2.md).

**Inherited Phase 2.1:** [Survey & Registry Pilot](docs/PHASE-2.1.md).

**Inherited Phase 1.4:** [Verified experience, NGO opportunities and invitations](docs/PHASE-1.4.md).

**Inherited Phase 1.3:** [Phase 1.3 scope, permissions and checklist](docs/PHASE-1.3.md). Search/filter volunteers in 50-record pages, manage NGO operating areas/programs, maintain private shortlists and assign separate staff roles.

## Included

- Email/password signup, confirmation, login, logout and password recovery.
- Safe signup defaults: new accounts are volunteers; client metadata cannot grant admin access.
- POEM Super Admin / POEM Admin, NGO Admin memberships and volunteer workspaces.
- CV-style profile drafts, submissions, review feedback and L0/L1 verification display.
- Editing invalidates previous approval; optimistic version checks reject stale saves/reviews.
- Partner NGO self-onboarding, private registration evidence, POEM approval, operational status and assignment of registered accounts to organizations.
- One account can belong to multiple NGOs; explicit workspace switching.
- Recruitment/application snapshots plus project/assignment-scoped NGO profile access; the old permanent profile-sharing control is not exposed in the current UI.
- Database-enforced permissions, active-account checks, protected RPC mutations and audit events.
- Admin geography manager and cascading volunteer location selection.
- Private PDF/JPG/PNG volunteer documents with upload recovery, removal and POEM review.
- Verification checklist and document-review gates; evidence changes invalidate approval.
- In-app notifications with recipient-only read access.
- Local first-Super-Admin bootstrap helper, `.env.example`, locked npm dependencies and validation scripts.

## Important boundaries

- This is a development foundation. It is not the full POEM roadmap or a certified production release.
- App accounts are active after email confirmation. Volunteer profiles are self-published/active; independent verification is separate. NGO memberships are assigned through the current POEM/NGO administration rules. Account suspension is separate from profile publication and identity verification.
- Legacy database profile status `verified` means active/published profile in compatibility code; independent identity verification, completed training and performance are separate concepts.
- NGO “active” is operational approval. POEM 2.13 stores private onboarding evidence and records the application decision, while independent organization verification remains a separate governance concept.
- Volunteer recruitment access is application/assignment-scoped in the current UI. Beneficiary coordination remains a separate explicit source-NGO approval plus POEM authorization workflow with field allowlist, expiry and revocation. Past viewed/copied data cannot be recalled.
- Volunteer profiles now use the project-supplied Pakistan Province/Territory → Division → District → Taluka/Tehsil/Subdivision reference hierarchy. Islamabad skips Division. Union Council is manual/optional and full address is mandatory. Admin geography tools remain available for controlled maintenance; existing approvals survive upgrade until edited/reviewed.
- Survey builder and project-scoped provisional person/household registry are included. POEM survey managers also have a canonical cross-project identity foundation with explainable candidate review and reversible merges. Phase 2.5 adds controlled partner-NGO coordination summaries. Phase 2.6 adds encrypted device drafts and queued reconnect sync after a project/form has loaded; cold-start offline navigation, offline documents/photos and full PWA caching are still not included. Workforce payable accounting is included, but custodial account balances/payment-provider transfer, automatic performance scoring, bulk beneficiary export and SMS/email notifications beyond Auth are not included.
- No migration/import from the older Cloudflare/Sites database is included.
- Volunteer directory uses server-side filters and 50-record pages with authorized counts. Supporting UI lists still cap at 500 accounts/organizations, 1,000 memberships and 100 events; keep the operational pilot within those supporting-list caps.
- Database revocation takes effect on the next request; already rendered data is not remotely erased. Refresh the UI after account, membership, organization or grant changes.
- Never put service-role keys or server secrets into any `VITE_*` variable. The build includes a check for common secret-key mistakes.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci
npx supabase start
npx supabase migration up --local
npm run env:local
npm run dev
```

Requires Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`) and Docker for local Supabase. Frontend runs directly in WSL. No extra Dockerfile is required for this phase.

## Checks

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:local
```

POEM 2.4.2 keeps `npm run test:operations` fixture teardown canonical-registry-aware. POEM 2.5 adds a dedicated embedded PostgreSQL sharing/RLS suite. POEM 2.6 adds structural regression checks for encrypted IndexedDB drafts/queue semantics and global field-sync wiring. POEM 2.7 adds an embedded PostgreSQL marketplace/assignment lifecycle suite. POEM 2.7.1 adds seeded Pakistan geography and profile-location regression checks. POEM 2.7.2 adds runtime profile/geography regression coverage and strict non-ICT district-parent validation.

The first three were run in the build environment. `npm test` runs the real SQL migration and RLS workflows using embedded PostgreSQL (PGlite) with a simulated Auth schema and JWT subject. The 26 foundation tests, 19 document/geography regression tests 22 Phase 1.3 tests 28 Phase 1.4 tests 20 Phase 2.1 tests 23 Phase 2.2 tests and 25 Phase 2.3 tests simulate Auth and Storage metadata; they do not verify actual Auth or Storage HTTP services. `test:local` verifies real local Auth/API and private Storage upload/download/removal once Docker is running; it is supplied for local execution and was not run in this environment.

These references informed the local CLI setup, database access controls and Auth recovery flow. Browser UI testing, external email delivery and production deployment remain separate verification steps.

Document controls and release limits: [Phase 1.2 architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). No server-side malware scanner is included. Public rollout needs a scanning/quarantine workflow and a retention policy.

[Supabase Storage access controls](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/security/access-control) and [bucket restrictions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets) informed the private upload workflow.
